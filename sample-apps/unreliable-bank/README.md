# Example: unreliable-bank

This is a extremely simple example of how one could implement a
simple bank app using stage.

It is by no means a complete (or even functionally correct) bank
implementation, as it does not handle missing transactions,
duplicated transactions, overdraft, etc...

It serves as a basic library to exercise the `stage` package
and make integration tests easier to write.
